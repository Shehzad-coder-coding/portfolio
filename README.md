# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code of my personal portfolio website built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The design is simple, clean, and user-friendly, focusing on a smooth browsing experience and professional presentation. The primary purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my work, skills, and contact information in an attractive and easy-to-navigate layout.

The homepage includes a bright and welcoming design with a clear header section, a navigation bar, a concise introduction, and a “Hire Me” section for quick access. The project section displays multiple sample project boxes with a uniform layout, allowing visitors to view my work at a glance. Each box highlights the project visually and maintains consistency in styling.

The contact form at the bottom of the page allows users to reach out easily. It includes input fields for name, email, phone, subject, and message, all styled cleanly to match the theme of the website. The footer contains social icons such as Facebook, Instagram, GitHub, and personal branding information, making the portfolio feel complete and professional.

This website is optimized for deployment on Render, Netlify, Vercel, and GitHub Pages. The file structure is simple and easy to update, making it suitable for future improvements and additional sections such as Skills, Services, or a Full Project Showcase.

Feel free to explore the code or deploy the site globally.
